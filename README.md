Welcome to `DevThing`.

`DevThing` is an open source project manager for software development.
It runs 100% on the browser, consisting of a **single HTML file**.

You can find the source code at https://github.com/ruivieira/devthing.

`DevThing` development is done in `DevThing` itself.
A live demo can be found at https://ruivieira.github.io/devthing/.

The documentation **is** the demo.
